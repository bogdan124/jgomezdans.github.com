have a myriad formats, these keep changing, and you can never know what
metadata will be available in them. A clever way around this situation
is to use tools that allow you to read most of the data, most of the
associated metadata, and that let you do the usual minor tweaks that
you'll require to get things working. And this means GDAL (for rasters)
and OGR (for vectors).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typical problem: you get some data you've never seen before, and it is
linearly scaled (so they put it in as a 16bit integer and you need to
apply a linear mapping to get the units right as floating point numbers).
In the GDAL mailing list &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/gdal-dev/2012-July/033504.html"&gt;there's a thread on this&lt;/a&gt;
using the MODIS SST product.&lt;/p&gt;
