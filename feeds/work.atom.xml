The
EOLDAS software is a prototype &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_assimilation"&gt;data assimilation&lt;/a&gt; framework for the land
surface, although it is quite generic, and can be used for typical variational
problems, with a weak or a strong constraint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, we are using a radiative transfer code as an observation
operator, and imposing weak constraints in land surface state components,
rather than a fully-fledged dynamic vegetation model, for example. This
dynamic model merely states that the state today is the same as yesterday,
but with some uncertainty. This is implemented as a differential operator,
and is the idea behind Tikhonov regularisation.&lt;/p&gt;
